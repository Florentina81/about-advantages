        Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream and
        flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice,
        such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
        It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid
        nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to
        stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and
        stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals
        from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at
        very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable
        as its temperature increases. Ice cream may be served in dishes, for
        eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be
        served with other desserts—such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice
        cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and baked items.
